Title: Automated Calibration for Complex (Ecological) Models
Description: Automated calibration for complex (ecological) models in R. 
  The calibrar package allows the calibration of complex models, 
  including stochastic ones. It is a generic tool that can be used for 
  any type of model, especially those with non-differentiable objective functions. 
  It supports multiple phase calibrations and constrained optimization. 
  It implements maximum likelihood estimation methods and automated construction 
  of the objective function from simulated model outputs.
